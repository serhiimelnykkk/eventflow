# EventFlow Platform Documentation

## Brief Description

EventFlow is a comprehensive platform designed to simplify the process of organizing, promoting, and participating in various events such as webinars, conferences, workshops, concerts, or sports competitions. It allows organizers to easily create events, manage registrations and ticket sales, and interact with participants. For attendees, the platform offers convenient event search by categories, date, or location, quick registration and payment, and timely notifications. The platform is designed with modularity and scalability in mind, divided into key services, ensuring its flexibility and future growth.

## Quality Requirements

### 1. Usability

**[USR-1] Intuition**: The user interface must be intuitive and easy to use without requiring special training for basic functions.

**[USR-2] Registration Efficiency**: The event registration/ticket purchase process for an attendee should take no more than 4 steps.

**[USR-3] Responsiveness**: The platform must be responsive and display correctly across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

**[USR-4] Feedback**: The system should provide clear and timely feedback on user actions (e.g., save confirmation, error messages).

### 2. Performance

**[PERF-1] Response Time**: The system should respond to user actions (page loading, search execution, registration) in under 1.5 seconds in 90% of cases.

**[PERF-2] Load Handling**: The platform must support at least 5000 concurrent active users without significant performance degradation during peak loads (e.g., popular event announcement, ticket sale start).

**[PERF-3] Image Loading**: Images and media files should load efficiently without blocking the main content of the page.

### 3. Scalability

**[SCAL-1] Horizontal Scaling**: The architecture should allow for horizontal scaling of individual microservices to handle increasing data volumes and requests.

**[SCAL-2] Adding New Categories/Features**: Adding new event categories, ticket types, or new functional capabilities should not require significant changes to the core system.

**[SCAL-3] Geographical Scaling**: The system should be able to scale to support users in different geographical regions.

### 4. Security

**[SEC-1] Data Protection**: User data (passwords, payment information) must be securely stored (e.g., passwords hashed using bcrypt, payment data tokenized or not stored at all, using PCI DSS-compliant payment gateways).

**[SEC-2] Communication Security**: All API requests and web traffic must be secured using HTTPS/TLS.

**[SEC-3] Access Control**: A Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model must be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions (e.g., only organizers can create events, only attendees can register).

**[SEC-4] Attack Protection**: The system should be protected against common web attacks (OWASP Top 10), such as XSS, SQL injection, CSRF.

### 5. Availability

**[AVAIL-1] Uptime**: The system must maintain an uptime of at least 99.9% per month.

**[AVAIL-2] Fault Tolerance**: Failure in one service should not lead to a complete collapse of the entire system (fault tolerance and resilience required).

**[AVAIL-3] Backup**: A mechanism for regular data backup and restoration capability must be implemented.

### 6. Maintainability

**[MAINT-1] Service Independence**: Each microservice should be independently deployable and modifiable without affecting others.

**[MAINT-2] Code Standards**: The codebase should adhere to agreed-upon coding standards and development best practices.

**[MAINT-3] Test Coverage**: Unit and integration tests must cover at least 80% of critical code.

**[MAINT-4] Documentation**: Code and architectural decisions must be properly documented.
